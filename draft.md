## Overview

This pipeline is engineered to streamline the processing and analysis of large datasets, drawing inspiration from Pinterest's infrastructure. It orchestrates the seamless integration of data ingestion, storage, and real-time analysis, leveraging a robust suite of technologies. By unifying AWS services, Apache Kafka, Databricks, and Apache Airflow, it exemplifies a sophisticated approach to data engineering, designed to accommodate both the scalability demands and the analytical depth required by modern data ecosystems.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion and Storage**
  - Utilizes **AWS S3** for secure, scalable storage of batch data.
  - Integrates **AWS API Gateway** and **Kafka** (via AWS MSK) for efficient real-time data streaming.

- **Data Processing**
  - Leverages **Databricks** for advanced data analytics, employing **Apache Spark** for both batch and stream processing.
  - Implements **Lambda architecture** for handling vast datasets with a balance of speed and accuracy.

- **Workflow Orchestration**
  - Uses **Apache Airflow** (AWS MWAA) for orchestrating and automating the data pipeline workflows, ensuring timely execution of data processing tasks.

- **Real-Time Data Streaming**
  - Incorporates **AWS Kinesis** for real-time data collection and analysis, enabling immediate insights and responses.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
  - Applies comprehensive data cleaning techniques in **Databricks notebooks** to ensure data quality and reliability for analysis.
  - Employs custom **Python** scripts and **Spark SQL** for data transformation and preparation.

- **Analytics and Reporting**
  - Facilitates advanced data analytics within Databricks, using both **PySpark** and **Spark SQL** for deep dives into the data.

- **Security and Compliance**
  - Adheres to best practices in cloud security, leveraging AWS's robust security features to protect data integrity and privacy.

- **Scalability and Performance**
  - Designed for scalability, easily handling increases in data volume without compromising on processing time or resource efficiency.


## Architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

requirements.txt, other software like kafka, confluent, api etc make a list here

### Installation
